# WindowsFormsContacts

First project created with C# in the .NET framework.
Project based on CRUD, using Windows Form and SQL Server.
It contains a Business Logic Layer in charge of making the necessary validations and a Data Access Layer in charge of accessing the database.
There are still some details to solve, such as when a Contact is deleted, the id of the list has to be updated.
